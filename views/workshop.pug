      p How do intelligent systems, such as human beings and software agents, learn about the world? Animals learn about themselves and their environment, and how the two interact effectively and efficiently, through self-motivated exploration and experimentation. High-level learning, e.g. the use of specialized tools, can be learned both by example and by building upon existing learned competencies. Approaches exploring mixed learning mechanisms in open worlds in artificial intelligence (AI) has for the longest time seemed out or reach. An overemphasis on particular topics, e.g. machine learning, has lead fundamental cognitive faculties found in nature to receive less attention than they deserve, including cumulative (online, life-long) learning, attention, analogy making, and creativity. A self-supervised learner in a complex, open world must possess a variety of cognitive processes - including these, and more - to allow it to learn a variety of new skills, develop new cognitive capabilities, compare situations and objects for various purposes, and how to use those objects as tools â€” through exploration. </p>
      p In the rush to produce high-performing 'intelligent' systems (e.g. problem solvers and classifiers) with immediate appliation, AI has relied on hand-crafted frameworks, coded using human-readable programming languages (e.g PDDL, propositional logic, etc.). Hand-crafted systems are notoriously brittle as the number of rules tends to be small and overly rigid, underspecifying even moderately complex tasks and environments. Even modern machine learning methods themselves rely extensively on hand-crafting and close supervision, leaving unaddressed many cognitive processes required for AI systems with broader, more general skills. In short, current AI paradigms seem inadequate for realizing the advanced intelligent robotic systems of the future that the founding father of AI hoped to see.</p>
      p Future AI systems must be able to adapt to new environments, be more robust in the face of complexity and uncertainty, and will improve with their experience in the real world. Their control and learning strategies, whatever form they may take, may rely on a variety of knowledge representation schemes to address incremental, open-ended learning and cognitive development. Rules learned through active exploration or mimicking tend to be more numerous and less brittle than hand-crafted ones. Self-supervised learning is squarely in our path towards more general machine learning; time will tell whether self-motivated learning will fuel the next wave of intelligent systems or the one after it. </p>
      p To make sure such systems materialize within the next decades we must revive the original goals of the field by raising the bar and broadening the range of target cognitive features existant in AI systems. Participants in IWSSL 2021 will discuss the development and evaluation of self-supervised learners, setting a research agenda for a wide-horizon long-view developmental approach to future intelligent systems and robots. </p>
