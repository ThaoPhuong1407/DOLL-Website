                                    | Hi there, I'm Thao. If you want to see my past, check out my 
                                    a(href="http://www.thao-phuong.com/images/Resume.pdf") resume
                                    | . But the pass won't defind the future. Thus, I will tell you what I can do.
                                    | My biggest achievement is to continuously surpass my current self. 
                                    | Usually, people want to achieve the big next goal because they want to seek 
                                    | validation from others, which is a good thing. I am, too, a highly competitive 
                                    | person. But the more crucial part, in my perspective, lies in the ability to see 
                                    | myself as a real competitor. This way, I can always strive to become better and never stop learning.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    | I want to learn many things, ranging from web and app development to multiple machine learning aspects. 
                                    | However, all of my learnings serve only 1 purpose -- that is to make the world a better place. 
                                    | It doesn't have to be the next big thing. Tiny changes that bring little improvement to many 
                                    | lives are the idea. So if you also want to contribute as I do, don't hesitate to reach out!
