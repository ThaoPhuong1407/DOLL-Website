        h1 WHY WE'RE HERE 
        p We believe in augmenting human intelligence, not replacing it.

        p Dynamic Object Language Labs, Inc. was established in 1993 to promote the synergistic 
        | combination of Dynamic and Open Languages, Object Oriented Programming, and Artificial 
        | Intelligence.  We conduct advanced research and development aimed at providing a brighter 
        | and safer future through advances in computer based technology and its application to 
        | real world problems.  DOLLâ€™s central theme is to approach complex problems from a domain 
        | specific language perspective. Our research interests include Advanced Languages, 
        | Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Planning, Cyber Security, and Expert Systems.  
        | DOLL has a long history of exciting work in Self Adaptive Software, a software architecture 
        | concept that DOLL helped introduce in the 1990's. Self Adaptive Software has been used to 
        | build robust vision systems, intelligent spaces/rooms, intelligent control systems, 
        | and cyber security systems.  DOLL is currently performing on multiple projects in the area 
        | of cyber security, including self adaptive and game theoretic approaches.  DOLL has a long
        | history in the areas of vision architectures, robust vision systems, and intelligent perceptual systems.
