                        p Dynamic Object Language Labs, Inc. was established in 1993 to promote the synergistic 
                            | combination of Dynamic and Open Languages, Object Oriented Programming, and Artificial 
                            | Intelligence.  

                        p We conduct advanced research and development aimed at providing a brighter 
                            | and safer future through advances in computer based technology and its application to 
                            | real world problems.  DOLLâ€™s central theme is to approach complex problems from a domain 
                            | specific language perspective.

                        p Our research interests include Advanced Languages, 
                            | Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Planning, Cyber Security, and Expert Systems.  
                            | DOLL has a long history of exciting work in Self Adaptive Software, a software architecture 
                            | concept that DOLL helped introduce in the 1990's. 
                        p Self Adaptive Software has been used to 
                            | build robust vision systems, intelligent spaces/rooms, intelligent control systems, 
                            | and cyber security systems. DOLL is currently performing on multiple projects in the area 
                            | of cyber security, including self adaptive and game theoretic approaches.
